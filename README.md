# libutp - The uTorrent Transport Protocol library.
Copyright (c) 2010 BitTorrent, Inc.

uTP is a TCP-like implementation of [LEDBAT][ledbat] documented as a BitTorrent
extension in [BEP-29][bep29]. uTP provides reliable, ordered delivery
while maintaining minimum extra delay. It is implemented on top of UDP to be
cross-platform and functional today. As a result, uTP is the primary transport
for uTorrent peer-to-peer connections.

uTP is written in C++, but the external interface is strictly C (ANSI C89).

## The Interface

The uTP socket interface is a bit different from the Berkeley socket API to
avoid the need for our own select() implementation, and to make it easier to
write event-based code with minimal buffering.

When you create a uTP socket, you register a set of callbacks. Most notably, the
on_read callback is a reactive callback which occurs when bytes arrive off the
network. The write side of the socket is proactive, and you call UTP_Write to
indicate the number of bytes you wish to write. As packets are created, the
on_write callback is called for each packet, so you can fill the buffers with
data.

The libutp interface is not thread-safe. It was designed for use in a
single-threaded asyncronous context, although with proper synchronization
it may be used from a multi-threaded environment as well.

See utp.h for more details and other API documentation.

## Example

See app/ucat.c. Build with:
 
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake .. -DBUILD_APP=ON
	cmake --build . --target install

See app/ucat.cpp . The is used libevent.

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake .. -DBUILD_APP=ON -DLibevent_DIR=${libevent_cMake_path}
	cmake --build . --target install

You can find ucat in build/bin/${CONFIGURE}/ucat in windows, or build/app/ucat in other system.

## Building

uTP has been known to build on Windows with MSVC and on linux and OS X with gcc.

### Depend

#### [CMake](https://cmake.org/)

CMake is a tool, that generates native makefiles and workspaces.
It integrates well with a number of IDEs including Qt Creator and Visual Studio.

#### [libevent(optional)](https://github.com/libevent/libevent)

Only the application depend on libevent.

### linux

building the shared library is as simple as:

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake .. -DBUILD_APP=OFF
	cmake --build .
	cmake --build . --target install

To build one of the examples, which will statically link in everything it needs
from libutp:

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake .. -DBUILD_APP=ON
	cmake --build . --target install


### windows
#### msvc

ag. Visual Studio 15 2017 

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake .. -G"Visual Studio 15 2017" 
	cmake --build . --target install

    
#### mingw

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake .. -G"MinGW Makefiles" 
	cmake --build . --target install


### android

	mkdir build
	cd build
	export ANDROID_NDK=/absolute/path/to/the/android-ndk
	cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=`pwd`/../cmake/Platforms/android.toolchain.cmake
	cmake --build . --target install

## Packaging and API

The libutp API is considered unstable, and probably always will be. We encourage
you to test with the version of libutp you have, and be mindful when upgrading.
For this reason, it is probably also a good idea to bundle libutp with your
application.
